# Building-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-System
This repository contains the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using ChromaDB and LLaMA3 8B instruct model. The system aims to enhance the performance of language models by integrating retrieval mechanisms to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods. This project utilizes ChromaDB for efficient retrieval and LLaMA3 8B instruct model for generation. By integrating these components, the system can provide enhanced responses by leveraging relevant retrieved information.
